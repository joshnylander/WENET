  <p>1. Introduction<a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This document defines
      a standard protocol enabling inquiry of disparate law and justice data
      systems. These data systems, called record management systems (RMS), are
      built on
      a variety
      of platforms with an assortment of technologies. On the surface, these
      RMS systems perform different tasks, but they all store common, but discrete
      pieces of data that are used throughout the law and justice
      process. This protocol and its companion schema
      document, define both a common data format
      for exchange and a standard process to authenticate, inquire, and
      retrieve commonly formatted data. This document builds on the concepts
      in the November 2002 report by the MIS committee of the Whatcom County
      Law and Justice Council entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.whatcomcounty.us/boards/lawjustice/pdf/mis_nov2002_report.pdf">Data
      Integration &amp; The Criminal Justice System in Whatcom County </a>&quot;.
      This document also builds on the presentation given July 10th of 2003 in
      Bellingham to project members and vendors (<a href="http://www.whatcomcounty.us/apps/wenet/wenet_technical_plan-part_1.ppt">Power
      Point portion of presentation is available</a>). However in some instances
      it has been necessary to deviate from both the report and the presentation.</p>
    <p>Specifically, this protocol specifies methods to inquire an agency RMS
      to <a href="#query">retrieve</a> both a <a href="#results">list</a> of
      document instances that contain the requested information and the <a href="#instance">instances</a> themselves.
      Additionally, methods are specified for <a href="#discovery">discovery</a>, <a href="#authorization">authorization</a>, <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> and <a href="#auditing">auditing</a>.</p>

  <p>1.1. Requirements Terminology<a name="terminology" id="terminology"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Keywords &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD
      NOT&quot; and &quot;MAY&quot; that appear in this document are to be interpreted
      as described in [<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. Client / Service Model<a name="clientservice" id="clientservice"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For the purpose of this protocol the term &quot;client&quot; refers to
      an application, typically used by a person (&quot;user&quot;) that inquires
      a &quot;service&quot;. A &quot;service&quot; (also sometimes refered to
      as a &quot;service point&quot;) is considered an implementation of this
      protocol. A client typically makes requests and services typically provide
      responses. A single agency may provide multiple services. It is expected
      that a client will 
      inquire against multiple services in order to compile the complete data
      set. Both services and clients may exist on the same or different hosts
      but must
      be able
      to
      communicate
      via HTTP
      to
      the requested services.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2.1 Proxy Services<a name="proxy" id="proxy"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A proxy is a special type of service that doesn&#8217;t have to retrieve
      data from a local RMS system. Rather, it can choose to route requests to
      another service point and then (if it chooses) modify the returned data
      before finally sending it to the client. In this way, a proxy can act as
      both a service-endpoint as well as a client (by distributing functionality).
      For example, a caching proxy service could route queries to various service
      points only if it did not have a locally cached copy of the data. Another
      example might be a Geographic Mapping proxy service that intercepts data
      returned by other service points and builds a map based on all geographic
      information contained in the results, and then includes the map data with
      the returned results. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3. URIs<a name="uri" id="uri"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This protocol uses Uniform Resource Identifiers as specified by the IETF
      [<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</a>]
      for both URLs and for URNs [<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2141.txt">RFC
      2141</a>]. URLs are used by this protocol to specify the technology (often
      called protocol), the host, and the name of methods and data sources exposed
      by services implementing this protocol. An example of a URL used to identify
      the discovery method would be &quot;http://wenet.co.whatcom.wa.us/as400/discovery.jsp&quot;.
      URNs are used to uniquely identify specific data sets such as a service
      description, an agency's/RMS's information about a person or an agency's/RMS's
      information about an event. An example of a URN identifying a person in
      an RMS would be &quot;wenet.co.whatcom.wa.us/as400/person/johndoe&quot;.
      Each agency MUST be identified with a unique URN. Each service MUST be
      identified with a unique URN. Each unique data set, such as Person, Warrant,
      and Arrest data sets from an RMS, MUST be identified with unique URNs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4. HTTP<a name="http" id="http"></a></p>
  <p>4.1 Secure HTTP<a name="securehttp" id="securehttp"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Clients and services MUST communicate via HTTP [<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>] over TLS [<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt">RFC 2818</a>] or SSL. Services must authenticate for all requests. Except for retrieval of service descriptor, which only requires service authentication, both services and clients MUST authenticate each other with valid and authorized digital certificates. Services MUST present a digital certificate that matches the certificate listed in the service document. Clients SHOULD verify that the certificate received from the server during SSL authentication matches the certificate listed in the service document of that respective server. Services authenticate one another by ensuring the others service certificate is derived from one of the common &ldquo;Service Signing Certificates&rdquo;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4.2 HTTP GET<a name="httpget" id="httpget"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The methods exposed by service points are accessed via the HTTP GET method.
      Each service provides (in their service descriptor) a list of methods,
      which includes their HTTP types, their parameters, and their corresponding
      URLs. In most cases, additional parameters are required, for example, the
      name of a person to search for. In this case this protocol specifies a
      specific text string, which MUST exist in the URL that is to be replaced
      with the appropriate parameter. In this way clients can, via simple string
      replacement and HTTP GET requests; retrieve results and documents from
    a service. All REQUIRED methods are implemented via HTTP GET. All HTTP GET URLs MUST be properly escaped. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4.3 HTTP POST<a name="httppost" id="httppost"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A few methods that allow for advanced inquiry require the use of the POST
      method of HTTP. As a simplistic description, a POST allows a stream of
      additional data to be attached to the request. For each method requiring
      POST this protocol specifies the stream content
      and
      format expected by the service method.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4.4 HTTP Error Messages<a name="httperror" id="httperror"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whenever possible the service SHOULD respond with the most appropriate
      HTTP status code and SHOULD strive to extensively use status codes for
      error, missing or not found information. Specifically all clients SHOULD
      understand the following status codes: 200, 301, 305, 307, 400, 401, 404,
      408, 410, 414, 500, 501, and 503.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4.5 Methods<a name="methods"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This protocol defines 6 methods that a service MUST implement and one
      method that a service MAY implement. A service may implement additional
      methods not defined by this protocol as long as they follow the method
      listing rules of the protocol. Below is a <a href="#tableofmethods">table</a> listing
      the methods and for each method, its name, whether it is listed in the
      methods list, HTTP request type, parameters and whether a method or parameters
      are required. Most methods, the
      URL and any parameters needed to execute them are defined in the service
      document. A few  methods are intrinsic in the protocol and thus not
      listed in the <em>wenet:service</em> document, such as the discovery method
      itself, which is just a URL used to retrieve the <em>wenet:service</em> document
      or result method which is listed in response to a query.  The <em>wenet:service </em>document
      lists the methods supported by the service, the HTTP request type, a brief
      description, the URL to execute the method
      and the supported parameters. Only parameters which are optionally supported must be specified in the service document. Any required parameters may be specified but MUST be assumed if not present. In the case of HTTP GET methods, the parameters
      are applied to the URL with simple find/replace of the parameter name surrounded
      by exclamation points (!) found in the URL with the value. For HTTP POST
      parameters, they are applied as properly escaped form parameters.</p>
    <p>The first method is called &quot;discover&quot;
      and is accessed via HTTP GET and detailed in section <a href="#discovery">6</a>.
      The second method is root schema discovery  is accessed via HTTP GET
      and is detailed in section <a href="#xpathroots">6.3</a>. The third method
      is called &quot;authlist&quot; which
      is accessed via HTTP GET and detailed in section <a href="#authorization">7.2</a>.
      The fourth method is called &quot;auditlog&quot; which is accessed via
      HTTP GET and detailed in section <a href="#auditing">7.3</a>. The fifth
      method is called &quot;query&quot; which
      is accessed via HTTP GET and is detailed in section <a href="#simple">8.2</a>.
      The sixth and last required method is called &quot;retrieval&quot; which
      is accessed via HTTP GET and is detailed in section <a href="document">8.1</a>.
      The one optional method is called &quot;complex
      xquery&quot; is accessed via HTTP POST and detailed in section <a href="#complex">8.4</a>.</p>

  <p>5. WENET Schema<a name="schema" id="schema"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A companion document [<a href="../schema/wenet/wenet_schema_1-2-2.xsd">WENET
      Schema</a>] to this one defines the schema for top level XML types used
      by this protocol. For each request their is a corresponding type specified
      in the schema that is returned by the service as a complete and properly
      formatted XML document with HTTP content type text/xml. This document
      will identify XML data types in italics with these custom types having
      the namespace prefix of <em>wenet</em>. For example, the WENET service
      document is of type <em>wenet:service</em>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6. Discovery<a name="discovery" id="discovery"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Discovery allows for clients to discover and connect to all available
      services and for services to connect to each other.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6.1 Clusters<a name="clusters"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Clients and services may belong to more then one cluster. While
      outside of the scope of this document, it is anticipated that all agencies
      within a single cluster will agree to a common agreement on security and
      GJXDML rules. <br />
    Client software may combine results from multiple clusters.</p>
    <p>Each service
        will include in its service descriptor the list of clusters it belongs
        to. An example of a possible cluster configuration is with agencies A,
        B, C, D. Agencies A, B, C could be grouped in a cluster, while agencies
        B, C, D could be in another cluster. Users in agencies B and C can access
        both agencies A and D's data while users in agency A can not access data
      from agency D and vice versus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6.1.1 Service Hierarchy <a name="hierarchy" id="hierarchy"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Within clusters, services MAY be organized into a hierarchy. This hierarchy
      allows for indexing services, proxies and other services in a priority
      fashion. Each service defines which, if any, service is its parent within
      a given cluster. Clients SHOULD first attempt queries against the services
      without parents and then move down the hierarchy until their request is
      met. A service that does not define a parent within a cluster is at the
      top of the hierarchy. Multiple services may exist at the same level in
    the hierarchy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6.2 <em>wenet:service</em><a name="service"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service MUST provide via HTTP GET for the retrieval of a XML document
      of type wenet:service. The service descriptor (a.k.a. service document)
      contains information about the service such as contact information, disclaimers,
      method access URLs, and digital certificate. The service descriptor
      also contains a list of the clusters it belongs to and the services in
      those clusters. In this way the client software SHOULD only need the URL
      of one service descriptor in order to discover other services participating
      in the data-sharing cluster. As noted in <a href="#securehttp">section
      4.1</a>, the service descriptor
      MUST be available without the client authenticating and MUST not contain privileged
    information.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6.3 Supported XPaths<a name="supportedxpaths" id="supportedxpaths"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Included in the service descriptor is a list of the xpath  elements
      available to query against at that service. The client SHOULD verify that
      the query elements are supported by the service. Elements returned in the
      <em>wenet:summary</em> section of the <em>wenet:results</em> documents will be marked with
      an attribute boolean value, default of false, set to true.</p>

  <p>7. Security<a name="security" id="security"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Security in WENET is based on  trust relationships between
      separate agencies. Agencies wishing to share data are expected to enter
      into written contracts specifying the security relationship. This includes
      defining the types of users participating in each particular role. Such
      contract specifics are outside the scope of this technical document.</p>
    <p>Services establish a trust relationship amongst each other so that they
      may directly query each other. As noted in <a href="#clusters">section
      6.1</a>, it is anticipated
      that agencies in trust relationships will be grouped together within a
      cluster.</p>
    <p>Authorization lists are
        specified at the user level and define the roles a
      user belongs to. Since each agency is in the best position to
      know
        who of its users should have access to what type of data, it is expected
      but not required that authorization lists be provided by and maintained
      by each agency. The authorization
        list contains all of the names, other identifying information and
        what roles the agency says the users should be able
      to use.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>7.1. Authentication<a name="authentication" id="authentication"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service MUST provide in their <em><a href="#authorization">wenet:authlist</a></em> a
      list of digital certificates which are authorized by the service to sign
      user certificates
      for the users it represents. In this way the
       client authenticates, on behalf of the user, with a user digital certificate
      signed by an authorized certificate. The user's digital certificate MUST
      contain the X.509 v3 extended attribute &quot;Subject Alternative Name&quot; which
      MUST contain the value &quot;RFC822 Name=username&quot; where username
      is an authorized username (see <a href="#authorization">Section 7.2</a>).
      The service authenticated against uses the username to determine if the
      user is authorized  to make the request and to log the request.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>7.2. Authorization<a name="authorization" id="authorization"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service MUST provide for method authlist via HTTP GET for the retrieval
      of a XML document of type <em>wenet:authlist</em> which contains the list
      of authorizing certificates and a list of users that the service represents.
      The document contains a list of users
      and
      the roles
      the users is a member of. Each user is identified by an e-mail style username.
      This username SHOULD be
      a valid e-mail address but
      at the
      least MUST be globally unique. The username must match the username identified
      by the users digital certificate(s). In addition to an e-mail address,
      each user has a URL that MAY be used to retrieve information about the
      user. This MAY be a XML document containing contact information. Each service
      MUST from time to time contact the other services in the clusters it belongs
      to in
      order
      to retrieve
      the
      latest copies of authorization lists. The service MUST only
      allow other services to retrieve the list. Services MUST identify themselves
      to each other by authenticating their end of the connection with a
       the <em>wenet:serviceCertificate</em> and this certificate MUST be signed
       (or have a parent signed) by a certificate trusted by the other service.
       It it anticipated that each service will have a list of one or more certificates
       that it will use to establish trust of service certificates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>7.3. Auditing<a name="auditing" id="auditing"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service MUST record the username, date, time,  request URL, and POST
      content, if any, of each authenticated request made. This record MUST be
      made available as method auditlog via HTTP GET as a
      XML
      document of type <em>wenet:auditlog</em>. The auditlog method takes one
      parameter, &quot;!xpath!&quot;.
      The client is to replace this string with the XPath query statement.  The XPath query MUST be a valid XPath rooted
      in the <em>wenet:auditlog</em> element. This method MUST only be available
      to other services in the same way as the authlist method. Services MAY
      log unsuccessfully authenticated requests. If not logged here, services
      SHOULD log all attempts at web server contact in a log available for review
      by the local security auditors.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>8. Query</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The primary function of a service is to provide
      for querying of an agencies RMS system and retrieval of RMS data. Services
      make RMS data available in the form of XML documents of type <em>wenet:instance</em>.
      There are two way to provide query, one simple
      and
      mandatory
      and
      the other more complex but optional.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>8.1<em>wenet:instance</em><a name="instance" id="instance"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service must provide via HTTP GET for the retrieval of a XML document
      of type <em>wenet:instance</em>. The document identifies the unique URI
      for this data, when the data was last updated in the RMS,
      the unique URI for the agency owning
      the the
      data, the unique URI of the service providing
      the data and a unique URI representing the data set itself. The <em>wenet:instanceElement</em> of
      the document contains a top level data element from the list of supported
      root elements (see Section <a href="#xpathroots">6.3</a>).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>8.2<em>wenet:results <a name="results"></a></em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <em>wenet:results</em> document
      contains a collection of result elements. Each result element contains
      the instance URI, the agency URI, the service URI, the document URI, the
      date/time last updated, a subset of the data, and most importantly the
      URL that may be used to retrieve the instance document. If
      there were no matching results then the collection will be empty. In addition
      to the result elements, the <em>wenet:results</em> document
      contains information identifying what service it comes from, the url used
      to query it, a check back url and any errors. </p>
    <p>In some instances the service
        point may not be able to deliver results within the 90 second HTTP window.
        In those cases the service point MAY queue the request, return an empty
        result set and provide for retrieval of the result set later. In this
      case, the check back url
        element contains a URL that the client can use to check back with
        the
        service
        to see if the 
        processing is finished and if so retrieve the results. This feature is
        OPTIONAL. The <em>wenet:checkBackURL</em> element
        should only exist with an empty elements collection and when the check
        back later feature is implemented by the service. The client MAY check
        back
        at the URL at any time. If the results are not ready then the service
        will return an empty result set with a <em>wenet:checkBackURL</em> element
        for the client to try again later. If the service implements the check
        back
        option, the service MUST keep check backs open until successfully retrieved
        or 24 hours have expired. The client MAY give up at any time.</p>
    <p>If there were errors in processing the query and an HTTP error is not
      appropriate to describe the error, the <em>wenet:results</em> MAY contain
      one or more <em>wenet:error</em> elements with the description of the error
      and an attribute, <em>wenet:errorNumber</em>, which
      is from the list below.</p>
    <table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>

  <p>8.3 Simple Query<a name="simple" id="simple"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each service MUST provide for method query via HTTP GET for the retrieval
      of a XML document of type <em>wenet:results</em>. This document contains
      a list of instances which match the XPath query passed via the GET URL. <a href="TO%20DO">XPath
      v1.0</a> syntax SHALL
      be used to query the data sets made available by the service. The XPath
      statement is made against XML documents of type <em>wenet:instance</em> rooted
      in a root element supported by the service (see section <a href="#xpathroots">6.3</a>).
      The service descriptor specifies a URL for this method. The URL is a standard
      URL except
      where
      the XPath
      statement should go the URL contains a string, &quot;!xpath!&quot;. The client is to replace this string with the
      XPath query statement.</p>
    <p>In addition to the &quot;!xpath!&quot; parameter, the URL also contains the &quot;!namespaces!&quot; parameter. In this parameter MUST go the list of namespaces and namespace prefixes used in the XPath. The format for this is &quot;xmlns:[prefix]='[namespace]'&quot; (without the double quotes). For example, to map prefix j to namespace http://www.it.ojp.gov/jxdm/3.0.2 would look like (without double quotes) &quot;xmlns:j='http://www.it.ojp.gov/jxdm/3.0.2'&quot;. Multiple namespaces are to be seperated by a space character (properly escaped).</p>
    <p>In this way the client may create an XPath statement, escape it if necessary,
      substitute it into the URL, authenticate to the service using a valid digital
      certificate, make an HTTP GET request with the URL and retrieve a collection
    of results in the form of a <em>wenet:results</em> document and then resolve
    that list to retrieve the requested data.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>8.4 Complex Query<a name="complex" id="complex"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This protocol supports XQuery in place of XPath.
      A service
      MAY provide via HTTP POST for XQuery as an OPTIONAL method.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>8.4.1 XQuery <a name="xquery" id="xquery"></a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  method complex xquery allows for the posting a XQuery as
      defined by the W3C XQuery v1. The XQuery MUST be properly escaped and posted
      as field &quot;xquery&quot;.</p>
